ApkeSU third-party notices
==========================

This file records direct third-party dependencies and build-time source inputs
used by this repository. It complements LICENSE, NOTICE, and
GPL-COMPLIANCE.md.

ApkeSU is an open-source derivative of
[KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), with changes focused on the
Manager experience, interface extensions, LKM patching, and personal-device
debugging. The project periodically incorporates upstream source updates,
security fixes, and feature work from KernelSU.

Keep the upstream license text and notices with any redistributed binary
artifact. For release audits, also verify transitive dependency licenses from
the committed lock files and published package metadata.

1. Project license split
------------------------

ApkeSU inherits KernelSU's license split:

  - kernel/ is GPL-2.0-only unless an individual file says otherwise.
  - non-kernel KernelSU-derived code is GPL-3.0-or-later unless an individual
    file says otherwise.
  - third-party dependencies remain under their own licenses.

Redistributions must preserve the upstream origin, applicable license texts,
and third-party notices. Modified public distributions, including released
kernels, APKs, and modules, must provide the complete corresponding source as
required by the applicable license.

2. NPM packages

Gradle resolves additional transitive dependencies from the repositories above.
For binary releases, generate a dependency report from Gradle and preserve all
licenses/notices from resolved artifacts.

Suggested release check:

  cd manager
  ./gradlew :app:dependencies --configuration releaseRuntimeClasspath

4. LKM build inputs
-------------------

Source files:

  - .github/workflows/build-lkm.yml
  - .github/workflows/ddk-lkm.yml

Direct external build inputs:

| Input | Version/ref used by repo | License/source note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ghcr.io/ylarod/ddk-min | `${kmi}-20260313` | Android DDK container used only to compile kernelsu.ko. Kernel headers and generated kernel build files follow the Android common kernel/Linux GPL-2.0-only model; LLVM/Clang and Android build tools keep their own upstream notices. Keep the container/upstream notices with published KO build logs where applicable. |
| `userspace/ksud/bin/aarch64/*_kernelsu.ko` | [KOWX712/KernelSU](https://github.com/KOWX712/KernelSU), `master` at `60e7841b5ce1d0dc5aafd4d4898cd5dccacb270f` (2026-07-21) | Precompiled KernelSU LKM source reference. The exact build commit is not embedded in the `.ko` metadata and must be replaced with the actual build ref when known. |
| GitHub Actions official actions | checkout, upload-artifact | Build-service actions used at CI time; not vendored into release artifacts. |

The repository does not vendor the DDK container. It is fetched by CI at build
time and remains governed by its upstream licenses.

The KOWX712 KernelSU source uses GPL-2.0-only for `kernel/` (see
`kernel/LICENSE`) and GPL-3.0-or-later for the remaining project code (see
`LICENSE`). Redistribution of the referenced `.ko` files is permitted under
those applicable GPL terms, provided that the corresponding license texts,
copyright notices, and complete corresponding source (or the GPL-required
source offer) are preserved with the redistributed artifact.

The `.ko` ELF metadata reports `license=GPL`, but does not contain a Git
commit. The commit above is the audited upstream `master` reference, not a
claim that it is the exact build commit; record the exact build ref before
publishing a release when it is available.

When publishing a KO package, include:

  - the exact ApkeSU source revision;
  - the exact KMI and DDK release;
  - the generated binary artifact and enough build instructions to reproduce it.

5. ReSukiSU Dynamic Manager reference
-------------------------------------

The ApkeSU Dynamic Manager implementation was designed with reference to the
Dynamic Manager feature, IOCTL command allocation, and loading approach in
[ReSukiSU/ReSukiSU](https://github.com/ReSukiSU/ReSukiSU), audited at commit
[`0b5efe9e0102c43ca5c41174d500f5a7080cd0c7`](https://github.com/ReSukiSU/ReSukiSU/commit/0b5efe9e0102c43ca5c41174d500f5a7080cd0c7)
(2026-08-31).

The port follows the ReSukiSU certificate-only ABI and loading semantics in these upstream areas:

  - `kernel/feature/dynamic_manager.c` and `.h`;
  - `userspace/ksud/src/android/dynamic_manager.rs`;
  - the Manager Dynamic Manager repository, model, use cases, ViewModel, and UI.

ReSukiSU applies GPL-2.0-only to its `kernel/` directory and GPL-3.0-or-later
to the remaining project code. ApkeSU retains the same applicable license split
for this port. The IOCTL operations, certificate-only `{size, hash}` state,
dynamic signature index `255`, manager enumeration, APK selection, and manual
certificate entry intentionally follow ReSukiSU. ApkeSU-specific integration
keeps its built-in primary Manager restricted to `io.github.fixz.apkesu`, uses
its existing supercall/ksud lifecycle, persists state atomically, migrates the
previous ApkeSU schema-v1 certificate, and hardens incomplete scans and APK ZIP
validation. No ReSukiSU fixed-manager certificates or Vivo package variant are
included. See `docs/DYNAMIC_MANAGER.md` for the security contract and
limitations.

6. SukiSU-compatible GKI KPM interface
---------------------------------------

ApkeSU's Native GKI KPM interface is an explicitly declared compatibility
implementation. Its ABI and GKI integration were designed with reference to
[SukiSU-Ultra](https://github.com/SukiSU-Ultra/SukiSU-Ultra), audited at
commit
[`9fbe8fe8ca90c62c259c5894bf96d02ac31209b9`](https://github.com/SukiSU-Ultra/SukiSU-Ultra/commit/9fbe8fe8ca90c62c259c5894bf96d02ac31209b9).
It is not an official SukiSU-Ultra distribution and does not imply endorsement
by that project.

The related early-boot runtime and image patcher are pinned from
[SukiSU_KernelPatch_patch](https://github.com/ShirkNeko/SukiSU_KernelPatch_patch)
at commit
[`c5f0785dc7fac22a846eecc6392f34198d8e18b5`](https://github.com/ShirkNeko/SukiSU_KernelPatch_patch/commit/c5f0785dc7fac22a846eecc6392f34198d8e18b5).
The vendored source, declared license, source-date metadata, excluded build
artifacts, and local hardening are recorded in
`third_party/kernelpatch/SOURCE.json` and `docs/SUKISU_KPM_NOTICE.md`.

The ApkeSU implementation is limited to an AArch64 built-in GKI bridge
(`CONFIG_KSU=y`, `CONFIG_KPM=y`) and the declared KPM UAPI. Its supercall
authorization, ksud state machine, import validation, rescue recovery,
logging, and Manager integration are ApkeSU-specific. LKM and late-load builds
do not use this backend; they use the separate KPatch-Next path. This notice
does not relicense any upstream source: SPDX headers, upstream license texts,
and the source-availability requirements remain binding.

7. SUSFS GKI source patches
---------------------------

The built-in GKI SUSFS build downloads source patches from
[simonpunk/susfs4ksu](https://gitlab.com/simonpunk/susfs4ksu). The build
copies `kernel_patches/fs/*` and `kernel_patches/include/linux/*` into the
downloaded Android common kernel tree and applies the matching
`50_add_susfs_in_gki-*.patch`. These files are build-time source inputs; they
are not stored as generated kernel artifacts in this repository.

Reproducible builds use the branch-specific commits recorded in
`.github/config/gki-commits.json`:

| SUSFS branch | Pinned commit |
| --- | --- |
| `gki-android12-5.10` | `e466df60670eab2847ea76940be2f8a125c8adc9` |
| `gki-android13-5.10` | `805e7e853bf49df671c9efed772a5e744ae6fa9e` |
| `gki-android13-5.15` | `01b08bf995c22c25f6361539d6b89435504528d9` |
| `gki-android14-5.15` | `a96b41434e401565158b8eb19a4fe8855143ce99` |
| `gki-android14-6.1` | `596ec8fcdcb5a6ee366494304333c7fdc76d8862` |
| `gki-android15-6.6` | `72997d308cf0d55003ad4695ebde130ef9fc5201` |
| `gki-android16-6.12` | `55e16cb62127057f36a16e6a3068217ba5dade31` |

The upstream repository carries the GNU GPL version 3 license text. Preserve
its copyright and license notices and provide the complete corresponding
source for distributed builds. Individual imported files do not currently
carry SPDX identifiers, so this notice records the source repository and exact
revisions without claiming that those files have been relicensed under
ApkeSU's project-wide license split.

SUSFS source patches are enabled only for built-in AArch64 GKI builds with
`CONFIG_KSU_SUSFS=y`. LKM builds continue to use ApkeSU's existing dynamic-hook
implementation. Android 17 / Linux 6.18 is intentionally excluded because the
upstream repository does not publish a matching GKI source patch.
